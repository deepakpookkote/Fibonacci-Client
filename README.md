# Fibonacci-Client
 a simple game to guess a colour that is randomly picked based on Fibonacci series. 
 
 Game details:
The game should have the option to get the name from the user and provide an option to start the game. Once the game starts, the user is shown 10 coloured buttons with each button representing a colour. The game has 6 rounds and in each round a colour is picked by the system based on the Fibonacci series i.e 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. In round 1, the first color button will be the right answer. Similarly in round 6, the eighth colour button will be the right answer.

In each round the user has to guess the right colour by clicking on the button. If the guess is right, the user is awarded with positive points. If the guess is wrong, then the user is awarded with negative points. After each guess the user moves to the next round and on completion of round 6 the game gets over.

At the end of the game the score is displayed to the user and the score should be saved in the database.
